# Python-Multiprocessing

The main goal is to test how multiprocessing and multithreading can be used in Python, and under which circumstances one may be a better option than the other.

## Installation

WIP

## Execution
To execute this platform we just need to run the local Flask server by executing the following command:

```bash
python server.py
```

Once executed, you can check out the website at `localhost:5000`.

## Installation
Python3.9.7 was used to make this project, although any Python3.7+ version should work. `requirements.txt` is provided to install the dependencies.

## Execution
To execute this platform we just need to run the local Flask server by executing the following command:

```bash
python server.py
```

Once executed, you can check out the website at `localhost:5000`.
